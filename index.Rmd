# Getting Started

This online book is meant to serve a computation reference for the text Bayesian Psychometric Modeling by Robert Mislevy and Roy Levy.
I hope that having a detailed computation guide using Stan is of interest to someone.

Throughout this book, I have incorporated elaborations on the code to help set up the examples and provide more details when possible.
The authors provided an accompanying [website](http://bayespsychometrics.com/book-examples/), where the examples are shown using ` WinBUGS` and ` Netica`. 
The later is used in Chapter 14 for estimation of Bayesian networks.
I wanted to deeply dive into this text so rerunning all the examples in a different language provides an excellent excuse to do so.

Also, since I can go into more detail in this format than they could, I have not restricted myself by cutting short of the analysis.
Meaning that I have done my best to fully (or sufficient for the example) analyze the posteriors to see what issues may pop up and how I resolved them.

## Software 

We have used ` R` to call Stan. So we have relied on ` rstan` heavily.
